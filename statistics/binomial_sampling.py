Genralized Analytic Approach
1. Observe/ Synthesize some phenomenon in nature
    - ex. sitting on a park bench and looking at the feet of geese,
    and marking 1 if they have black feet or 0 if they have orange feet.
    - ex counting in binary and summing the bits \
        (for a fixed length of bits)
    
2. Create a means to organize and observe our results
    - ex. packing values into a dictionary and printing them to terminal

3. Describe or interpret the phenomenon through the lens of our observations
