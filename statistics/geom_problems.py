# Binomial

# What is the probability that some number out of some number of events is successful?
# p=0.3, n_trial=20, What is the probability that 18(k) are successes? binomial_pmf(n, p, k)

# Geometric
# The proba of some binary event is p. What is the probability of having your first success on the kth trial?

# Poisson
# On average, some number of events happens in this volume (of time, space, etc).

# What is the probability of some (other) number of events happen in this volume or in some expansion 
# or contraction of this volume?
